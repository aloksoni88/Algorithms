 * Question
 * Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

	Examples:	
	Input : str1 = "heap", str2 = "pea" 
	Output : Minimum Deletion = 2 and
	         Minimum Insertion = 1
	p and h deleted from heap
	Then, p is inserted at the beginning
	One thing to note, though p was required yet
	it was removed/deleted first from its position and
	then it is inserted to some other position.
	Thus, p contributes one to the deletion_count
	and one to the insertion_count.
	
	Input : str1 = "geeksforgeeks", str2 = "geeks"
	Output : Minimum Deletion = 8
	         Minimum Insertion = 0
